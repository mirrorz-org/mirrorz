# MirrorZ

Your next MirrorS is not MirrorS, nor MirrorSes, it's MirrorZ.

A final site for Mirror sites.

## Demo

[https://mirrorz.org](https://mirrorz.org). Currently `mirrorz.json` for each Mirror site is real-time or statically generated by their maintainers or by a third party.

Also legacy webpages (for w3m and noscript users) are provided in [https://mirrorz.org/\_/](https://mirrorz.org/_/)

A speed test script [oh-my-mirrorz.py](https://mirrorz.org/oh-my-mirrorz.py) is also provided. See [README](scripts/oh-my-mirrorz/README.md) to more info.

## Intro

Mirror sites are heterogeneous. It is hard for a single mirror to provide all mirrors, so differences occur.

For end users, this is not a good experience as they need to search for available mirrors.

To make things easy, MirrorZ is intended to include all mirrorS, so a unified interface is needed.

## Data Format v1.4 (draft)

A `mirrorz.json` in the following format describes all the data of one mirror site in MirrorZ.

```json
{
  "version": 1.4,
  "site": {
    "url": "https://example.org",
    "logo": "https://example.org/img/logo.svg",
    "logo_darkmode": "https://example.org/img/logo-white.svg",
    "abbr": "EXAMPLE",
    "name": "样例镜像站",
    "homepage": "https://blog.example.org",
    "issue": "https://github.com/example/issues",
    "request": "https://github.com/example/mirror-request",
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "group": "QQ: 10086 and/or Telegram @something",
    "disk": "may be any string showing usage of disk, e.g. usage",

  },
  "info": [

                {
                    "name": "10.7.0 (amd64, CD installer with xfce)",
                    "url": "/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.7.0-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso"
                }
            ]
    }
  ],
  "mirrors": [
    {
      "cname": "AOSP",
      "desc": "Android 操作系统源代码",
      "url": "/AOSP",
      "status": "S",
      "help": "/help/AOSP/",
      "upstream": "https://android.googlesource.com/mirror/manifest",
      "size": "596G"
    },
    {
      "cname": "AUR",
      "desc": "Arch Linux 用户软件库",
      "url": "https://aur.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn",

    }
  ]
}
```

### Notes

* `version` is optional for version 1.x
* previous versions of this protocol could be found in git history; protocols in v1.x are back-ward compatible
* `site` provides the global info about one mirror site
* only `site.url` and `site.abbr` are mandatory
* `site.logo` should not be of format `ico`. Also, at least 64x64 resolution is required
* `site.logo_darkmode` is used when browser uses dark mode. Note that it should be set only after `site.logo` is set
* `site.url` should not end with slash `/`
* `site.big` should be a valid url to a big file, used by `oh-my-mirrorz.py` for speed testing
* `info` is used for category view
* the name of `info.distro` should be agreed and have a mapping, maintained in `cname.json`
* `mirrors` is used for list view
* the name of `mirrors.cname` should be agreed and have a mapping, maintained in `cname.json`
* `mirrors.desc` may differ for each mirror site since there are `excludes` for some mirror site
* `mirrors.desc` may be empty
* if `mirrors.url` begins with a slash `/`, it should be appended to `site.url` to form a full url
* `mirrors.status` is a concat of strings of pattern `[A-Z](\d+)?`. Only one main status is allowed; the number of auxiliary status is not limited.
  - `S1600000000`: successful. (optional) last successful ended unix timestamp
  - `Y1600000000`: syncing. (optional) start to sync unix timestamp
  - `F1600000000`: failed. (optional) last attempt to sync unix timestamp
  - `P1600000000`: paused. (optional) the unix timetamp sync stopped
  - `U`: unknown
  - `X1600000000`: (auxiliary) next scheduled sync unix timestamp
  - `N1600000000`: (auxiliary) new mirror. (optional) unix timestamp the repo added
  - `O1600000000`: (auxiliary) old successful timestamp, used only when it is syncing or failed
* `mirrors.help` may be empty, or the same rule as `mirrors.url`
* `mirrors.upstream`, `mirrors.size` may be empty

## MirrorZ, Mirror site, Third party

MirrorZ only provides the data format (including `cname.json`), frontend and related scripts (e.g `oh-my-mirrorz.py`). Audit on data format, content (e.g. `cname.json`) and adopted technologies (e.g. using reverse proxy in parsers) can be done by MirrorZ.

The term 'Mirror site' refers to an actual mirror site and/or the corresponding organization.

The term 'Third party' refers to individuals/organizations that contribute to this project. This may overlap with 'Mirror site'.

Data like `mirrorz.json` or `site.json` and parsers in `src/parser` are contributed/maintained by some Third party, and can be placed in this repo for convenience. More specifically, to make parser/data usable by MirrorZ (e.g. data format, CORS policy) is the responsibility of one Third party; also it is optional for one Third party to support some feature like legacy page and oh-my-mirrorz.

## Contributing and Developing

### Third party

For one Third party, it should either add and maintain their url to a mirrorz json file in `src/config/upstream.js` and `src/config/mirrors.js` (legacy page and script support), in the url `https` is needed, and the url should be widely accessible (not limited to campus) as all users of `mirrorz.org` would request that url; or integrate their frontend parser in `src/parser` and `src/Root.jsx`, where the generated `mirrorz.json` is called dynamic `mirrorz.json`, and may generate a static `mirrorz.json` by [debug interface](https://mirrorz.org/debug) in `/static/json/legacy/` and add the corresponding url in `src/config/mirrors.js` for legacy page and script support.

For Third party providing an url to a mirrorz json file, it may also contribute their `mirrorz.json` generating scripts in the directory `scripts`.

Big changes by Third party should be made through PR like adding a new parser/generating script. Small changes like changing content in `site.json` or generating scripts can be done by pushing to master.

### Frontend

One may use

```
yarn --frozen-lockfile
yarn start
```

to start a local server.

To use static files, 404 redirection (emulate Github pages) and legacy pages, one may use

```
yarn --frozen-lockfile
yarn full_start
```

to start a local server. Python3 is required in this case.

### Deployment

For dynamic web page part, only

```
yarn build
```

is required.

However if one also wants to deploy the static web page, one may use

```
yarn build
yarn legacy_build
```

Note that `legacy_build` has dependencies on files `yarn build` has made.

### Misc

Currently `*.json` is ignored in `.gitignore` (not ignored in `/static`). If one wants to commit a json file, they should use `git add -f`.
